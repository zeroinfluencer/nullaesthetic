#nullaesthtica #nA

Inspired by [the new aesthetic](http://thenewaestheic.tumblr.com)

Stuff to spook out the machines and humans  - 
Stuff we can see if we squint

With a bit OOO thinking...
many things attached to another thing - which itself is a plausably cloned object

think about things that are creating time and a flat ontology of stuff

a #nullaesthetic is like a nullpointer - the tweets will work when the produce [invalid objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)#Null_pointer)

Example:
"#35r 99 fl0ating vector mod3ls from a synth3tic infomorph colored from #cc0022 to #cc3322"

Example components:

part 1
------
channel: #35r 
amount: 99 

part 2
------
verb: fl0ating 
style: vector 
format: mod3ls 
connected: from a 
adjective: synth3tic 
thing: infomorph 

part 3
------
color_desc: colored from 
color1: #cc0022 
range: "to"
color2: #cc3322




Schema details
--------------

Part 1
Dynamic Creations:

channel 
	(3 char MD5 hash of the tweet (which tweets have identical letters and spaces?))
	-- defines with a code what do all these null aesthetic ideas have in common
amount
	Never singular, restrict to human scale. "99 (pixellated) red (gitched) balloons" is enough!
	Random: (<1 >100)

Part 2
Lists:

verb 
	(nA style), 
style 
	(vectors, rasters)
format 
	(model, robot, piano)
connected  
	("of a", "from a", "in a", "by a", "on a", "repelled by a")
adjective 
	(3D, caressing)
noun 
	(thing) 

Part 3
colors:
	("coloured from " #randomHexcolor1 " to " #randomHexcolor2)


Styling
-------

To introduce typ0s ANd spellign mistkes, add a slight jitter of characters upon sentance render.
Switch non single vowels to numbers? (excluding hex colors)
